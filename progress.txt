## Codebase Patterns
- Use Textual framework for TUI (>=0.50.0) - imports from `textual.app`, `textual.containers`, `textual.widgets`
- TUI is separate module `echolog_tui.py`, imported lazily in `echolog.py` when `tui` action is used
- EchologRecorder class in `echolog.py` is the core recording engine - TUI should interact with this
- Tests run via `pytest` in the virtual environment
- Activate venv with `source .venv/bin/activate` before running commands

- Implemented: Basic TUI application with Textual framework
- Files changed:
  - echolog_tui.py (new) - TUI module with Dashboard, StatusPanel, TimerPanel, ChunkPanel, InfoPanel, LogPanel
  - echolog.py (modified) - Added import and call to run_tui() for `tui` action
- Acceptance criteria met:
  - `echolog tui` launches the TUI application
  - TUI displays main dashboard on startup
  - Application exits cleanly with `q` key
  - Typecheck passes (Python imports work)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Textual uses CSS-like styling via DEFAULT_CSS class attributes
  - Bindings are defined via BINDINGS class attribute with Binding objects
  - Use compose() method to build widget tree, on_mount() for initialization
  - query_one() to find widgets by ID/class, update() to refresh labels
